# ut ("Untitled")

**ut** is a statically typed programming language.

The project shall eventually include:

- a compiler
- an assembler (arch: AMD64, syntax: intel)
- a simple debug-friendly vm

The compiler and assembler will produce self-contained native binaries for Windows and Linux.

The project is implemented in Typescript and runs on [Deno](https://deno.land/).
